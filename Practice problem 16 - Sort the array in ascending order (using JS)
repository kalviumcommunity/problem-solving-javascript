Question : =>

Klaus Mikaelson and his daughter Hope were arguing about who is the smartest person in the family. Klaus who is a world-known Computer Engineer asked Hope who has not yet completed her college to write a program to sort the given array in ascending order. Can you help Hope?



Input Format:

Input consists of 1 integer and 1 array.

The integer corresponds to the size of the array.



Output Format:

The output consists of array elements after sorting.



Sample Input 1:

5

54

68

25

14

74



Sample Output 1:

The sorted array is:

14

25

54

68

74



Explanation:

Here we can compare the 1st value(54)with all the other values,54 is greater than 14 and 25 and hence 54 will get printed in the third position.

Repeat the same process for all the remaining values to get the output in sorted order.



Solution : =>

//YOUR CODE// 
 
function runProgram(input) {
    let ip = input.trim().split('\n');
    let N=+ip[0].trim();
	let A=ip[1].trim().split(' ').map(Number);
	for(let i=0;i<N;i++){
	    for(let j=0;j<N-i-1;j++){
			if(A[j]>A[j+1]){
				let T=A[j];
				A[j]=A[j+1];
				A[j+1]=T;
			}
		}
	}
	
	console.log(`Sorted array is: ${A.join(' ')}`)
}



if (process.env.USER === "") {
  runProgram(``);
} else {
  process.stdin.resume();
  process.stdin.setEncoding("ascii");
  let read = "";
  process.stdin.on("data", function (input) {
    read += input;
  });
  process.stdin.on("end", function () {
    read = read.replace(/\n$/, "");
    read = read.replace(/\n$/, "");
    runProgram(read);
  });
  process.on("SIGINT", function () {
    read = read.replace(/\n$/, "");
    runProgram(read);
    process.exit(0);
  });
}
